# ResellFinderWeb
ResellFinder is a tool for finding arbitrage opportunities by scraping the internet and cross-referencing prices for local listings and Ebay Listings, then filtering items to provide the user with a useful interface for finding local listing items with relatively low prices that have a potential for a high reselling margin on Ebay. The program uses an algorithm to determine the potential profit margin on a local listing by identifying the product and condition from the local listing, then using that information to determine the average selling price and popularity of the item on Ebay.

# Application
Resell Finder Web is a work in progress web application based on the Java Spring Framework and AngularJS. Currently, only the Spring Framework Backend is uploaded to the branch as an eclipse project.

The craigslist webscraper component is based on this project, which I am a co-author of: https://github.com/ryanjunglee1/CraigslistNotifier

Information retrieved from ebay is accessed with the official Ebay API, to run this program on your own system, you will need your own Ebay API key. 

A live demo will be created and linked soon.
